 abstract = {This paper deals with the reliability of human bone for radiocarbon dating and the influence of particular foods on the dating of the individuals in question. Non-terrestrial food, such as fish and shellfish, causes the radiocarbon age of human bone collagen to be too old because of the so-called reservoir effects in water. These reservoir effects can be especially large in river water. By measuring ∂13C and ∂15N in bone collagen, the consumption of non-terrestrial food can be identified (palaeo-diet studies). Examples of reservoir effect can be seen in both historically dated persons and in some prehistoric populations. In particular, medieval human bone should be considered an unreliable material for radiocarbon dating.},
